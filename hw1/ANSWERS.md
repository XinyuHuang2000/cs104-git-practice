3. more git questions
(a) unmodified
(b) README.md: modified
	fun_problem.txt: untracked
(c) staged staged
(d) modified modified
(e) README.md: staged
	fun_problem.txt: unmodified
	there is nothing in fun_problem.txt, because though we have add a line of text to it, we then change it back to how it was at the last commit by using git checkout
(f) it is both staged and modified
	This is because we have modified and staged the file before without commit it, and then we modified it again. The second time when we add the text, we are actually modifying the version at the last commit.
